Dataman-inspired Math Homework Helper (Still brainstorming the name)
Project Overview
This web-based application is inspired by the classic Dataman calculator, designed to assist children with their simple math homework and help parents create custom quizzes. It provides an interactive platform where kids can input math questions, attempt to solve them, and receive immediate feedback. Additionally, parents can create personalized question sets to help their children study effectively.

How It Works

The user (child or parent) logs into their account.
For students:

Input a math problem into the calculator interface or select a parent-created quiz.
The application presents the problem and waits for the user's answer.
If the answer is correct, the user receives positive feedback and can move on to the next problem.
If the answer is incorrect, the user can try again (up to three attempts).
After three unsuccessful attempts, the correct answer is displayed along with an explanation.


For parents:

Access the parent portal to create custom question sets.
Input questions and answers for their child to practice.
Monitor their child's progress and identify areas needing more practice.****
